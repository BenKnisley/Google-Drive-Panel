Google-Drive-Panel is a front end for the command line Google Drive 
client Grive. Google Drive Panel lets you sync any folder with your 
Google Drive, it could be a folder under your home directory, or on
your desktop, or a whole partition. Best yet, it it can be named 
anything you like. It puts a icon in your panel, giving you basic 
controls over adding files and syncing files. 

Usage is simple, to start run 'google-drive-panel' (without  quotes)
into the terminal, follow setup, and close terminal. If you would like 
it to start at login, add 'google-drive-panel' to startup applications.

To install from Github source (on a debian system, because this makes a
deb package, otherwise just move files where they need to go):
git clone https://github.com/Benknis/Google-Drive-Panel.git
cd ./Google-Drive-Panel
sudo chown -R root google-drive-panel/
sudo chown -R :root google-drive-panel/
dpkg -b google-drive-panel/
Then just install with software center, or other means.

Google-Drive-Panel has been tested on the following 
Ubuntu 13.04

Mint 15
May not work with other versions or distros. Feel free to modify to make
work on your computer.
